Apologies for the confusion.\n\nSure, although I would suggest that instead of going up to TOF, we could bring the other maintainers / contributors of this repo to chime in (William and John Wedig) as this started as a minor nit, that we can perhaps resolve within our repo (although it would be cool to see how TOF works).",

And shadowing the member variable with a parameter make the code more difficult to modifiy in the future. I made this mistake in patch-set one, and I thought I would fix it so future deveoplers are not also burned by this shadowing. \n\nhttps://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/c/openbmc/estoraged/+/52247/1/include/estoraged.hpp#57 \n\n\nThere is no discernible advantage to shadowing your member variables with parameters of the same. And, there is a very clear dis advantage, using the wrong one, (which I did, and other developers will do).\n\nEither ways, I am glad you are such a dedicated and thorough reviewer, thanks for all the hard-work you put in. Could you explain the pros, and cons you see to your shadow method.",
